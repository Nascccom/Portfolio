          <p>
              Hi there! I'm a young and ambitious frontend developer with a results-focused attitude. My
              expertise lies in React (JS/TS) and Redux Toolkit, and I'm constantly honing my skills by
              solving challenges on Codewars and learning new technologies through online courses. I'm open
              to considering project work or full-time employment opportunities in this field.
          </p>
